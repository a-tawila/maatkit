# This method accepts a $code coderef, which is typically going to return SHOW
# FULL PROCESSLIST, and an array of callbacks.  The $code coderef can be any
# subroutine that can return an array of arrayrefs that have the same structure
# as SHOW FULL PRCESSLIST (see the defined constants above).  When it sees a
# query complete, it turns the query into an "event" and calls the callbacks
# with it.  It may find more than one event per call.  It also expects a $misc
# hashref, which it will use to maintain state in the caller's namespace across
# calls.  It expects this hashref to have the following:
#
#  my $misc = { prev => [], time => time(), etime => ? };
#
# Where etime is how long SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST took to execute.
#
# Each event is a hashref of attribute => value pairs like:
#
#  my $event = {
#     ts  => '',    # Timestamp
#     id  => '',    # Connection ID
#     arg => '',    # Argument to the command
#     other attributes...
#  };
#
# Returns the number of events it finds.
#
# Technical details: keeps the previous run's processes in an array, gets the
# current processes, and iterates through them, comparing prev and curr.  There
# are several cases:
#
# 1) Connection is in curr, not in prev.  This is a new connection.  Calculate
#    the time at which the statement must have started to execute.  Save this as
#    a property of the event.
# 2) Connection is in curr and prev, and the statement is the same, and the
#    current time minus the start time of the event in prev matches the Time
#    column of the curr.  This is the same statement we saw last time we looked
#    at this connection, so do nothing.
# 3) Same as 2) but the Info is different.  Then sometime between the prev
#    and curr snapshots, that statement finished.  Assume it finished
#    immediately after we saw it last time.  Fire the event handlers.
#    TODO: if the statement is now running something else or Sleep for a certain
#    time, then that shows the max end time of the last statement.  If it's 10s
#    later and it's now been Sleep for 8s, then it might have ended up to 8s
#    ago.
# 4) Connection went away, or Info went NULL.  Same as 3).
#
# The default MySQL server has one-second granularity in the Time column.  This
# means that a statement that starts at X.9 seconds shows 0 seconds for only 0.1
# second.  A statement that starts at X.0 seconds shows 0 secs for a second, and
# 1 second up until it has actually been running 2 seconds.  This makes it
# tricky to determine when a statement has been re-issued.  Further, this
# program and MySQL may have some clock skew.  Even if they are running on the
# same machine, it's possible that at X.999999 seconds we get the time, and at
# X+1.000001 seconds we get the snapshot from MySQL.  (Fortunately MySQL doesn't
# re-evaluate now() for every process, or that would cause even more problems.)
# And a query that's issued to MySQL may stall for any amount of time before
# it's executed, making even more skew between the times.
#
# As a result of all this, this program assumes that the time it is passed in
# $misc is measured consistently *after* calling SHOW PROCESSLIST, and is
# measured with high precision (not second-level precision, which would
# introduce an extra second of possible error in each direction).  That is a
# convention that's up to the caller to follow.  One worst case is this:
#
#  * The processlist measures time at 100.01 and it's 100.
#  * We measure the time.  It says 100.02.
#  * A query was started at 90.  Processlist says Time=10.
#  * We calculate that the query was started at 90.02.
#  * Processlist measures it at 100.998 and it's 100.
#  * We measure time again, it says 100.999.
#  * Time has passed, but the Time column still says 10.
#
# Another:
#
#  * We get the processlist, then the time.
#  * A second later we get the processlist, but it takes 2 sec to fetch.
#  * We measure the time and it looks like 3 sec have passed, but ps says only
#    one has passed.  (This is why $misc->{etime} is necessary).
#
# What should we do?  Well, the key thing to notice here is that a new statement
# has started if a) the Time column actually decreases since we last saw the
# process, or b) the Time column does not increase for 2 seconds, plus the etime
# of the first and second measurements combined!
#
# The $code shouldn't return itself, e.g. if it's a PROCESSLIST you should
# filter out $dbh->{mysql_thread_id}.
#
# TODO: unresolved issues are
# 1) What about Lock_time?  It's unclear if a query starts at 100, unlocks at
#    105 and completes at 110, is it 5s lock and 5s exec?  Or 5s lock, 10s exec?
#    This code should match that behavior.
# 2) What about splitting the difference?  If I see a query now with 0s, and one
#    second later I look and see it's gone, should I split the middle and say it
#    ran for .5s?
# 3) I think user/host needs to do user/host/ip, really.  And actually, port
#    will show up in the processlist -- make that a property too.
# 4) It should put cmd => Query, cmd => Admin, or whatever
